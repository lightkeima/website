The Flutter codelabs provide a guided,
hands-on coding experience. Some codelabs
run in DartPad&mdash;no downloads required!


#### [Write your first Flutter app, part 1][]

Create a simple mobile app that generates proposed names
for a startup company. In part one, you'll use a package
that returns pairs of words at random and inserts them into
an infinite scrolling list. You can also find this
[codelab on flutter.dev][].



#### [Write your first Flutter app, part 2][]

Create a simple mobile app that generates proposed names
for a startup company. In part two, you'll extend the
example from part 1 to allow the user to select favorite
word pairs, and add a second "Saved Favorites"
page where users can view the selected names.
Finally, you'll change the app's theme color.


#### [Write your first Flutter app on the web][]

Implement a simple web app in DartPad (no downloads
required!) that displays a sign-in screen
containing three text fields. As the user fills out the
fields, a progress bar animates along the top of the
sign-in area. This codelab is written specifically for
the web, but if you have downloaded and configured
Android and iOS tooling, the completed app
works on Android and iOS devices, as well.


#### [Basic Flutter layout concepts][]

Use DartPad in a browser (no downloads required!)
to learn the basics of creating a Flutter layout.


#### [Building beautiful UIs with Flutter][]

A deeper "first dive" than "Write your first Flutter app."
In this codelab you'll create a chat app that includes a
simple animation, and customizes the UI for iOS and Android.


#### [Implicit animations][]

Use DartPad (no downloads required!) to learn how to use
implicit animations to add motion and create
visual effects for the widgets in your UI.

#### [Adding Google Maps to a Flutter app][]

Display a Google map in an app, retrieve data from a
web service, and display the data as markers on the map.


#### [Build a photo sharing app with Google Photos and Flutter][]

Build a field trip app that allows you and other
members of the trip to share photos.


#### [Building a Cupertino app with Flutter][]

Build a version of the Shrine shopping app
(used in the Material Design codelabs) using the
Cupertino package to create an iOS style look and feel.
Create multiple tabs and navigate between them.
Use the [provider][] package to manage state between screens.


#### [Firebase for Flutter][]

Connect a Flutter app to a Firebase database,
and use a transaction to update shared information.


#### [MDC 101 Flutter: Material Components (MDC) Basics][]

Learn the basics of using Material Components by building
a simple app with core components.  The four MDC codelabs
guide you through building an e-commerce app called Shrine.
You'll start by building a login page using several of MDC
Flutter's components.


#### [MDC 102 Flutter: Material Structure and Layout][]

Learn how to use Material for structure and layout in Flutter.
Continue building the e-commerce app, introduced in MDC-101,
by adding navigation, structure, and data.


#### [MDC 103 Flutter: Material Theming with Color, Shape, Elevation, and Type][]

Discover how Material Components for Flutter make it
easy to differentiate your product, and express your
brand through design. Continue building your e-commerce
app by adding a home screen that displays products.


#### [MDC 104 Flutter: Material Advanced Components][]

Improve your design and learn to use our advanced
component backdrop menu. Finish your e-commerce app
by adding a backdrop with a menu that filters
products by the selected category.
